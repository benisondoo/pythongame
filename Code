#Project: A Python Game - DARKNESS
#Name: Aaron Wang/ Benison Doo
#Period: 5
#Description: You wake up in the middle of nowhere, your only choice is to explore and hope to find the end, but you are encountered with monsters as you explore.
#Consitsting of three monsters:
#                           -Goblin
#                           -Skeleton
#                           -Giant Skeleton Goblin
#Code's Function: When you explore, using a a random number generater, you are encountered with an enemy, or with nothing. When a set number has been reached you are faced with the boss, it uses a list and a random number generater to have a move.
